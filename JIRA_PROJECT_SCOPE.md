# Jira Project Restriction

This repository is tied exclusively to the Jira project called "MyProject". Do not add, write, read, or update tickets related to any other projects in Jira.

All automation, integration, and ticket management must be scoped to "MyProject" only.


## Story point estimation

For story point estimation use fibonacci and try to use maximum 8 points. If a task looks like it will be more than 8 points, think of ways of breaking this task into smaller ones.

Consider the PR review time and the merge process in the story point estimation. Lets assume the combination of both take about 1 day to complete and this must be accounted in the task development time
